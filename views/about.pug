          //- p This is my elevator pitch. It is the elevator pitch to end all elevator pitches. Your mind is blown. Your mortal brain can scarcely process how well my prior experience maps to your open dev position. 

          p Nice to meet you! I am currently working on the Teamtreehouse Full-Stack JavaScript Tech Degree program studying both front-end and back-end web development. I love learning the new skills and technologies used to create web applications and I am very excited to finally fullfill my dream working as a web developer.
