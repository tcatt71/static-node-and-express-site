          //- p Description
          p Creating and building with code is amazing! Getting everything in place, running and coming alive is unbelievably incredible feeling; I feel very fortunate to be able to do this every day and look forward to working on an exciting team with great programmers.

          p When I'm not getting my code just right and making it as clean and maintainable as possible you'll find me gaming, spending time with loved ones and contemplating the richness of our lives.

          p Oh and dreaming in code!
